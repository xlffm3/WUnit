# 🤖 WUnit

WUnit is a simple re-coded JUnit inspired
by [JUnit A Cook's Tour](http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/cookstour/cookstour.htm).

The purpose of recoding JUnit is to understand OOP. WUnit scans and gets all the test class objects located
under [test package](https://github.com/xlffm3/WUnit/tree/master/src/main/java/test) using reflection. WUnit then
invokes all the methods where @Test annotation is present and prints log according to each result.

Several chaining methods from AssertJ library were implemented to assert simple test cases as follows:

* ``assertThatCode()``
* ``isInstanceOf()``
* ``hasMessage()``
* ``doesNotThrowAnyException()``

This project was coded in accordance
with [객체지향 생활 체조 원칙](https://developerfarm.wordpress.com/2012/02/03/object_calisthenics_summary/).
